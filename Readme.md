# Master's Project from Kai Benning (January 2018): Simulating the 2D-Ising-Model

Bergische Universit√§t Wuppertal (Physics Department) <br>
Advisor: PD Dr. Christian Hoelbling

## Julia code for the simulation of the 2D-Ising-Model:

Content:

* Implementation of Metropolis- and Wolff-Algorithm
and functions for calculating autocorrelation, energy, and heat-capacity

* Implementation of a simple Reweighting-Algorithm

* First Steps to Finite-Size-Scaling (critical temperature)

Furthermore:

Code was tested under v0.5.2 (May 10, 2017).
